# ObjectQL Work Plan — 2026 Q1 (Phase 1 Completion)

> Generated: 2026-02-06 | Status: **Active**  
> Roadmap Phase: 1 (Core Alignment, RBAC, Zod Schemas, Logging)

## Executive Summary

A full monorepo scan revealed **critical build-chain blockers** that prevent compilation of the core engine and all three plugin packages. This plan prioritizes unblocking the build pipeline first, then addresses architectural governance, test coverage, and roadmap alignment.

---

## Phase A: Build Chain Repair (Priority: CRITICAL)

Unblock the entire compilation pipeline. All subsequent work depends on this.

### A1 — Unify Zod Version ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Problem** | `@objectql/core` depended on `zod ^4.3.6` while every other package uses `zod ^3.23.8`. |
| **Resolution** | Downgraded `@objectql/core` to `zod ^3.23.8`. All 3 usages in core are compile-time only (`z.infer<>`) so no API migration was needed. |
| **Files Changed** | `packages/foundation/core/package.json` |

### A2 — Fix Missing Type Exports in `@objectql/types` ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Problem** | Types appeared missing because `dist/` was stale (built from an older source). The source already had `RuntimePlugin`, `RuntimeContext`, `MetadataItem`, `Filter`, `QueryAST`, `ApiRequest`, `ApiResponse`, `GatewayProtocol` etc. |
| **Resolution** | Rebuilt `@objectql/types` with `pnpm build`. All exports now available. Also removed unused `Data` import from `object.ts`. |

### A3 — Fix `@objectql/core` TypeScript Errors (93→0) ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Root Cause** | All 93 errors were caused by: (1) `node_modules` not installed (`@objectstack/spec`, `zod`, `@objectstack/runtime` missing), (2) stale `@objectql/types` dist. **No source code changes were needed in core.** |
| **Resolution** | `pnpm install` + rebuild types + rebuild plugins → core compiles with 0 errors. |

### A4 — Build the 3 Plugin Packages ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Resolution** | All 3 plugin packages (`plugin-formula`, `plugin-security`, `plugin-validator`) compile clean and produce `dist/` output after dependency install. No source changes needed. |

### A5 — Clean Up Ghost `runtime/server` Package ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Resolution** | Removed `packages/runtime/server/` entirely. It contained only stale `dist/` artifacts with no `package.json` or `src/`. |

---

## Phase B: Architecture Governance (Priority: HIGH)

Enforce the "Constitution" (`@objectql/types`) rules and clean up layering violations.

### B1 — ~~Remove Runtime Dependencies from `@objectql/types`~~ ✅ RESOLVED

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Resolved — Not a real issue |
| **Analysis** | `@objectql/types` uses `z.infer<typeof Data.XXXSchema>` to derive TypeScript types from `@objectstack/spec` Zod schemas. This is a **compile-time only** operation. The compiled `dist/*.js` contains ZERO references to `@objectstack/spec` or `zod`. The compiled `dist/*.d.ts` contains flattened pure TypeScript interfaces. |
| **Action Taken** | Moved `@objectstack/spec` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` in `package.json`. Both `@objectstack/spec` and `zod` are now correctly classified as devDependencies. Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reflect the "Protocol-Derived Types" architecture. |

### B2 — Unify `DriverConfig` / `DriverCapabilities` Types ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Problem** | Each of the 9 drivers independently defines identical `DriverConfig` and `DriverCapabilities` interfaces. |
| **Resolution** | Defined canonical `DriverCapabilities` interface (31 fields aligned with `@objectstack/spec`), `DriverType` enum, `BaseDriverConfig`, and `IsolationLevel` in `@objectql/types`. Removed 6 duplicate method declarations from the `Driver` interface (`aggregate`, `distinct`, `beginTransaction`, `commitTransaction`, `rollbackTransaction`, `disconnect`). |
| **Files Changed** | `packages/foundation/types/src/driver.ts` |

### B3 — Remove `@objectql/driver-utils` (Dead Code) ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Problem** | 990 lines of utility code (QueryAST, filters, transactions) with zero consumers. |
| **Resolution** | Removed `packages/drivers/utils/` entirely. Zero packages depended on it; all functionality was duplicated from core. |
| **Files Removed** | `packages/drivers/utils/` (entire directory) |

### B4 — Add `exports` Field to All Packages ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Problem** | No package defines conditional `exports` — all use legacy `main`/`types` entries. |
| **Resolution** | Added `"exports": { ".": { "types": "./dist/index.d.ts", "default": "./dist/index.js" } }` to 17 packages across foundation, drivers, protocols, and tools layers. |
| **Files Changed** | 17 `package.json` files |

### B5 — Fix `platform-node` Layer Violation ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Problem** | `platform-node`'s `tsconfig.json` references `../../drivers/sql` and `../../drivers/mongo`, creating a foundation→driver cross-layer dependency. |
| **Resolution** | Removed both cross-layer references from `tsconfig.json`. |
| **Files Changed** | `packages/foundation/platform-node/tsconfig.json` |

---

## Phase C: Test Coverage (Priority: MEDIUM)

### C1 — `plugin-security` Tests ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Before** | 1 test file (query-trimmer), 13 tests |
| **After** | 6 test files, **136 tests** covering: PermissionGuard (object/field/record/RLS + caching), FieldMasker (7 mask formats + FLS removal), PermissionLoader (storage init + precompile + 12 operators), ConfigSchema (Zod defaults + validation), Plugin integration (install + hooks + audit) |
| **Files Created** | `__tests__/permission-guard.test.ts`, `__tests__/field-masker.test.ts`, `__tests__/permission-loader.test.ts`, `__tests__/config-schema.test.ts`, `__tests__/plugin.test.ts` |

### C2 — `plugin-validator` TODO Implementation ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Implemented** | (1) `validateCustom()` — custom validator expressions via Function constructor in strict mode. (2) `evaluateCondition()` expression evaluation — safe expression eval. (3) `validateBusinessRule()` constraint.expression — same safe eval. |
| **Tests Added** | 11 new tests: custom validators (pass/fail/error/template/context), expression evaluation (business rules, conditions, error handling) |
| **Files Changed** | `src/validator.ts` (3 stubs → working implementations), `test/validator.test.ts` (+11 tests) |

### C3 — `@objectql/cli` Tests ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Resolved — No real issue |
| **Analysis** | The "lint failure" in test output is expected behavior — the CLI's own `lint` command intentionally tests invalid metadata naming. The `❌ Linting failed with errors` messages are stdout from a test case that validates the error path. All 18 tests pass (2 skipped). |

### C4 — ~~`driver-utils` Tests~~ N/A

Package removed in B3.

### C5 — Full CI Verification ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Build** | `pnpm build` — 29/29 successful |
| **Tests** | `pnpm test` — 49/49 tasks, 1,582 tests passed |
| **Excluded** | `driver-mongo` and `driver-redis` (require running external servers — infrastructure dependency, not code bug) |

---

## Phase D: Roadmap Phase 1 Completion

### D1 — Complete RBAC Storage Backends ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Implemented** | `RedisPermissionStorage` and `DatabasePermissionStorage` with ObjectQLError-based validation and deterministic reload behavior. |
| **Files Changed** | `packages/foundation/plugin-security/src/storage-redis.ts`, `packages/foundation/plugin-security/src/storage-database.ts`, `packages/foundation/plugin-security/src/permission-loader.ts` |

### D2 — Structured Logging Framework ✅

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Implemented** | Unified `Logger` usage via `@objectql/types` across core gateway, hook manager, and plugins; removed external `createLogger` dependency in foundation plugins. |
| **Files Changed** | `packages/foundation/core/src/gateway.ts`, `packages/foundation/core/src/optimizations/CompiledHookManager.ts`, `packages/foundation/core/src/plugin.ts`, `packages/foundation/plugin-security/src/plugin.ts`, `packages/foundation/plugin-security/src/permission-loader.ts`, `packages/foundation/plugin-formula/src/formula-plugin.ts`, `packages/foundation/plugin-validator/src/validator-plugin.ts` |

### D3 — AI Namespace Preparation ✅ (Foundational)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Foundational Complete |
| **Implemented** | Runtime AI namespace types (`AiRegistry`, `ModelRegistry`, `PromptRegistry`, RAG interfaces) + core in-memory registries + docs. |
| **Files Changed** | `packages/foundation/types/src/ai.ts`, `packages/foundation/core/src/ai/registry.ts`, `packages/foundation/core/src/plugin.ts`, `content/docs/extending/ai.mdx`, `content/docs/extending/meta.json` |
