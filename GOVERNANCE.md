# ObjectQL Governance

## Mission Statement

ObjectQL is committed to being a **permanently neutral, permanently open-source, and permanently free** universal data protocol and ORM standard. We believe in creating technology that empowers developers worldwide while maintaining the integrity of the ObjectQL specification.

## Core Principles

### 1. Permanent Neutrality
ObjectQL is developed and maintained as a **vendor-neutral** project. No single company or organization controls the direction of the project. All decisions are made transparently through community consensus and open governance processes.

### 2. Permanent Open Source
ObjectQL and all its core components are and will always remain **100% open source** under the MIT License. This commitment is irrevocable:

- ✅ The source code will always be freely available
- ✅ Anyone can use, modify, and distribute ObjectQL
- ✅ No features will be held back in proprietary versions
- ✅ No "open core" model - everything stays open

### 3. Permanent Free to Use
ObjectQL is and will always be **free of charge** for:

- ✅ Commercial use
- ✅ Private use
- ✅ Educational use
- ✅ Government use
- ✅ Non-profit use

There are no premium tiers, no usage limits, and no licensing fees - ever.

## Specification Protection

While ObjectQL's **implementation** is open source under MIT License, the **ObjectQL Specification and Protocol** itself is protected to maintain ecosystem integrity.

### What This Means

#### ✅ You MAY:
- Use ObjectQL in any project (commercial or non-commercial)
- Modify the ObjectQL implementation for your needs
- Create drivers, adapters, and extensions for ObjectQL
- Fork the project and create derivative works
- Build products and services using ObjectQL
- Implement ObjectQL-compatible systems

#### ⚠️ You MAY NOT:
- Create a competing specification using the "ObjectQL" name
- Claim compatibility with "ObjectQL" without conforming to the official specification
- Use "ObjectQL" branding for incompatible forks or derivatives
- Publish alternate "ObjectQL specifications" that deviate from the standard

### Why Specification Protection?

This approach (similar to Java, ECMAScript, and GraphQL) ensures:

1. **Ecosystem Consistency**: All ObjectQL-compatible tools work together
2. **Developer Trust**: Developers can rely on ObjectQL behaving consistently
3. **Innovation Protection**: Prevents fragmentation while encouraging innovation
4. **Quality Assurance**: Maintains high standards for the specification

### Trademark Notice

"ObjectQL" and the ObjectQL logo are trademarks used to identify the official ObjectQL specification and reference implementation. Use of these trademarks must comply with our Trademark Guidelines (see below).

## Governance Model

### Open Development Process

1. **Public Roadmap**: All major features and changes are discussed publicly
2. **RFC Process**: Significant changes follow a Request for Comments (RFC) process
3. **Community Feedback**: All proposals are open for community review
4. **Transparent Decisions**: Decision-making processes are documented and public

### Contribution Model

ObjectQL welcomes contributions from everyone. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are committed to:

- Reviewing contributions fairly and promptly
- Maintaining backward compatibility where possible
- Keeping the project well-documented
- Fostering an inclusive and welcoming community
- Making decisions in the best interest of the entire community

### Specification Evolution

Changes to the ObjectQL specification follow a strict process:

1. **Proposal**: Submit an RFC (Request for Comments) for specification changes
2. **Discussion**: Community review period (minimum 2 weeks for major changes)
3. **Consensus**: Maintainers work toward community consensus
4. **Implementation**: Reference implementation must be completed
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite must pass
6. **Documentation**: Complete documentation must be provided
7. **Release**: Versioned release with changelog

## Trademark Guidelines

### Permitted Use

You may use "ObjectQL" in the following contexts **without** permission:

1. To refer to the ObjectQL project itself
2. In documentation describing integration with ObjectQL
3. In blog posts, articles, or educational materials about ObjectQL
4. In project names like "ObjectQL Driver for X" or "X ObjectQL Plugin"

### Restricted Use

You must obtain written permission to:

1. Use "ObjectQL" as part of a company name
2. Register domain names containing "ObjectQL"
3. Use the ObjectQL logo in a way that implies endorsement
4. Create modified specifications and call them "ObjectQL"

### Compatibility Claims

To claim "ObjectQL-compatible" or "ObjectQL implementation," your software must:

1. Pass the official ObjectQL compatibility test suite
2. Implement the specification as documented
3. Not introduce breaking changes to the protocol

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the ObjectQL community are expected to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy toward other community members
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

Harassment, discrimination, or unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.
