# Understanding ObjectQL's Protocol-Driven Architecture

One of ObjectQL's core principles is being **Protocol-Driven, Not Code-Driven**. But what does this mean in practice?

## The Problem with Traditional ORMs

Traditional ORMs mix two concerns:

1. **What** you want (the business logic)
2. **How** to achieve it (the implementation details)

This creates several issues:

- Tight coupling to specific databases
- Difficulty in testing and mocking
- Hard to optimize queries
- Challenging for AI to generate correctly

## The ObjectQL Approach

ObjectQL decouples these concerns through a three-layer architecture:

### 1. The Intent Layer (YAML Schema)

```yaml
name: project
fields:
  name:
    type: text
    required: true
  status:
    type: select
    options: [planning, active, completed]
```

This layer is **database-agnostic**. It describes what you want, not how to achieve it.

### 2. The Compilation Layer

The ObjectQL engine acts as a **compiler**, not a runtime wrapper:

- Validates schema integrity
- Injects permission checks
- Optimizes query patterns
- Generates type definitions

### 3. The Driver Layer

Drivers translate the compiled AST into database-specific operations:

- `@objectql/driver-sql` → PostgreSQL, MySQL
- `@objectql/driver-mongo` → MongoDB
- `@objectql/driver-sdk` → Remote HTTP APIs

## Benefits for AI Code Generation

This architecture makes ObjectQL ideal for AI-driven development:

✅ **Hallucination-Free**: YAML schemas are validated before compilation
✅ **Type-Safe**: All operations are strongly typed
✅ **Testable**: Mock drivers for testing without a real database
✅ **Portable**: Change databases without rewriting business logic
