## Authentication Methods

ObjectQL supports multiple authentication strategies:

## 1. JWT Tokens (Recommended)

```bash
POST /api/objectql
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 2. API Keys

```bash
POST /api/objectql
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 3. Session Cookies

```bash
POST /api/objectql
Cookie: session_id=abc123...
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 4. User Context in Request (Development Only)

For testing and development, you can pass user context directly in the request:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_123",
    "roles": ["admin"]
  },
  "op": "find",
  "object": "users",
  "args": {}
}
```

⚠️ **Warning**: In production, always authenticate via headers, not request body.

## Permission System

ObjectQL enforces permissions at multiple levels, as defined in the [Permission Specification](../spec/permission.mdx):

1. **Object Permissions** (`object_permissions`): Controls which roles can perform CRUD operations on an object
2. **Field Permissions** (`field_permissions`): Controls which fields specific roles can read or update
3. **Record Rules** (`record_rules`): Conditional access based on record data (e.g., owner-only access)

**Permission Check Flow:**
```
Request → Authentication → Object Permissions → Field Permissions → Record Rules → Execute
```

**Example Permission Config:**
```yaml
# File: project.permission.yml

roles:
  - admin
  - manager
  - user

object_permissions:
  create: [admin, manager]
  read: [admin, manager, user]
  update: [admin, manager]
  delete: [admin]

field_permissions:
  budget:
    read: [admin, manager]
    update: [admin]

record_rules:
  - name: owner_access
    description: Owner has full access
    condition:
      field: owner_id
      operator: "="
      value: $current_user.id
    permissions:
      read: true
      update: true
      delete: true
```

See the [Permission Specification](../spec/permission.mdx) for complete details on the permission model.
