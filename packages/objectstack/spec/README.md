# @objectstack/spec

ObjectStack Protocol Specification - Type Definitions

This package contains the canonical wire-protocol type definitions for the ObjectStack ecosystem.

## Purpose

This stub package is part of the ObjectQL v4.0 migration to the @objectstack ecosystem. It provides:
- Protocol field types (FieldType, Field, SelectOption)
- Protocol object types (ServiceObject, IndexSchema)
- Protocol action types (Action)
- Protocol query types (FilterCondition)

## Migration Notes

This is a workspace stub package created during the ObjectQL type system cleanup phase. The real `@objectstack/spec` package will be published separately to npm.
