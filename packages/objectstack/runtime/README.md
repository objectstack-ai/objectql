# @objectstack/runtime

ObjectStack Runtime - Core Runtime Types

This package contains the runtime type definitions for the ObjectStack ecosystem.

## Purpose

This stub package is part of the ObjectQL v4.0 migration to the @objectstack ecosystem. It provides:
- RuntimePlugin interface
- RuntimeContext interface
- ObjectStackKernel interface

## Migration Notes

This is a workspace stub package created during the ObjectQL type system cleanup phase. The real `@objectstack/runtime` package will be published separately to npm.
