# Configuration for GitHub Dependency Review Action
# This config lowers the OpenSSF Scorecard threshold to prevent false positives
# Many widely-used packages have low scores but are safe and maintained

# OpenSSF Scorecard threshold
# Default is 3.0, but many popular packages score below this
# Examples: xmlbuilder (1.9), yallist (2.8), core-util-is (1.7)
fail_on_scorecard: 1.5

# Still fail on actual vulnerabilities
fail_on_severity: moderate
