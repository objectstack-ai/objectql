# Welcome to the ObjectQL Blog

We're excited to launch the ObjectQL blog! This is your go-to resource for:

## What You'll Find Here

## Why ObjectQL?

ObjectQL represents a fundamental shift in how we approach software development. Instead of writing boilerplate code, you define **intent** through declarative schemas. The framework handles:

- ✅ Type-safe database schemas

- ✅ Permission enforcement
- ✅ API endpoint generation
