# ObjectQL Roadmap

**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Current Version:** 3.0.0  
**Project Status:** Active Development

---

## Vision & Mission

ObjectQL aims to be the **Standard Protocol for AI Software Generation** - a universal data compiler that transforms declarative metadata into production-ready database operations across any backend.

### Core Principles

1. **Protocol-Driven, Not Code-Driven** - Define intent in YAML, compile to optimized database operations
2. **Security by Design** - RBAC rules compiled into SQL, not checked at runtime
3. **Zero Hallucination** - Strict type safety and schema validation for AI-generated code
4. **Universal Runtime** - Run anywhere: Node.js, Browser, Edge, Cloudflare Workers
