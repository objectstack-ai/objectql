## Authentication Methods

ObjectQL supports multiple authentication strategies:

## 1. JWT Tokens (Recommended)

```bash
POST /api/objectql
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 2. API Keys

```bash
POST /api/objectql
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 3. Session Cookies

```bash
POST /api/objectql
Cookie: session_id=abc123...
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 4. User Context in Request (Development Only)

For testing and development, you can pass user context directly in the request:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_123",
    "roles": ["admin"]
  },
  "op": "find",
  "object": "users",
  "args": {}
}
```

⚠️ **Warning**: In production, always authenticate via headers, not request body.

## Permission System

ObjectQL enforces permissions at multiple levels:

1. **Object-Level**: Can the user access this object at all?
2. **Operation-Level**: Can they perform this operation (read/create/update/delete)?
3. **Field-Level**: Which fields can they see/edit?
4. **Record-Level**: Which specific records can they access?

**Permission Check Flow:**
```
Request → Authentication → Object Permission → Field Permission → Record Permission → Execute
```

**Example Permission Config:**
```yaml
# user.object.yml
permissions:
  - profile: admin
    allow_read: true
    allow_create: true
    allow_edit: true
    allow_delete: true
    
  - profile: user
    allow_read: true
    allow_create: false
    allow_edit: true
    allow_delete: false
    record_filters:
      - ["owner", "=", "$current_user"]
```
