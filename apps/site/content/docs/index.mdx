## What is ObjectQL?

**ObjectStack ObjectQL** is a protocol and engine for generating domain-driven AI software. It decouples **Intent** (Schema & Logic) from **Implementation** (Database & Code).

By defining your data models, permissions, and business logic in simple standard formats (YAML/JSON), ObjectQL compiles them into a production-ready, type-safe, and secured backend.

### Key Features

  <Card title="Compiler, Not ORM" href="/docs/data-access">
    ObjectQL is not a runtime wrapper. It is a Database Compiler.

  <Card title="Security by Design" href="/docs/server">
    Permissions (RBAC) and Validation are injected automatically by the Core engine.
